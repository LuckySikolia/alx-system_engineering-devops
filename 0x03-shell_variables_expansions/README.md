Shell, init files, variables and expansions
=====================================================
Through this projects I learnt about shell scripting and the importance of good technical writing practices. 
 
• Expansions: The task manager uses shell expansions to allow users to create and edit tasks using simple, user-friendly commands.

• Shell Arithmetic: To ensure accurate date calculations, the task manager utilizes shell arithmetic to perform date math and determine task due dates.

• Shell Variables: The task manager makes use of shell variables to store user preferences and task details, making it easy to manage and manipulate task data.

• Shell Initialization Files: The task manager includes shell initialization files to automate the setup process and make it easy for users to get started.

• Atlas Command: The task manager also incorporates the Atlas command, a powerful tool for managing and deploying web-based applications.

• Technical Writing: In addition to the shell scripting concepts, this project emphasizes the importance of clear and concise technical writing.
